Each player controls a separate paddle:
- W and S for the left paddle
- Up and down arrow for the right paddle
 
*Note: These controls can be changed in settings*

Before the game starts, you can customize how the whole game is played (see [here](#customization)).
Once you start, a ball will spawn in the middle and go towards a random direction at the start. To score, you must hit the ball with your paddle into the goal behind your opponent's paddle. Once you reach a certain score, you win! During these rounds, items will spawn randomly in the arena which can be picked up by hitting the ball directly to them. Modifiers, which are set before the game, can change up how the whole game is played as well. To see the list of items and modifiers, click [here](#items-and-modifiers).
